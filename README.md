# Position-Animation
-Create an application with a DOM element that is moving left AND down at 5px per update. 
-This speed should be stored as separate speed variables in your code, not in the update function.
-Assume a 'world bounds' for this object to be 800x600
-When the ball reaches the edge of the bounds, bounce it.
